The functionality made available by this package can be divided into four
sections: reading in and reformatting data; making data non-identifiable;
generation of networks and (basic) social network analysis; and integration
of data into transmission models (in progress). The following flow chart
illustrates how the key functions in these categories relate to one another
and can be used as reference for how this package fits together.

![Flow chart split into sections corresponding to the next sections of this document. It shows the general flow of usage of the Movenet package, and how some of the important functions can be used to transform the data. This is covered in more detail in the next sections of this document.](man/figures/readme-flowchart.svg)
