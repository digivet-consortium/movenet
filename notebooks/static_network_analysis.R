#' ## Network size and density
#' Network size (number of nodes)
vcount(mygraph)
#' Number of edges
ecount(mygraph)
#' Density (n of edges / total possible n of edges)
#' Total possible edges = network size * (network size - 1) for directed graph

#' If we have more networks (or snapshots of the same network over time), we can plot distributions of these with hist
#' (may need unlisting)

#' ## Transitivity, structural balance, and hierarchy
#' Reciprocity (tendency with which network ties sent out by egos are returned by alters)
reciprocity(mygraph)
#' One can create a random graph with same size & density, to compare reciprocity to:
random_graph <- erdos.renyi.game(n = vcount(mygraph), p.or.m = edge_density(mygraph, loops = FALSE), directed = TRUE)

#number of active holdings (i.e. with >=1 edge) - & temporal trend
vcount(mygraph)
#number of registered movements - & temporal trend
ecount(mygraph)
#number of pigs moved - & temporal trend
#number of pigs moved between holdings of diff type


#holding size - & temporal trend

#loyalty patterns (req comparison of yearly snapshots)
#in-loyalty, out-loyalty - comparison for different holding types

#network components - overall & for each year
#
#(ingoing, outgoing) contact chains for different holding types


#methods of network analyses were described and introduced into veterinary science [4,5,6,7].
#Network analyses of pig movements were performed in several countries and highlighted the potential for pathogen spread and implications for control programs by estimating the potential transmission pathways between holdings connected by direct or indirect contacts [9â€“14].
#In Denmark, Bigras-Poulin et al. [16] described trade patterns of Danish pigs between Sept 2002 and May 2003. Their analysis covered only a short time period
