Movenet uses the [Statnet suite of packages](https://statnet.org/packages/) (e.g. NetworkDynamic and tsna) for (temporal) social network analysis. We are currently working on  the functions in this section - e.g. creation of a pdf report with network measures of particular relevance to disease transmission.

```{r setup}
library(movenet)

# Load example movenet-format movement and holding tibbles into the global environment:
data(fake_Scottish_movement_data, package = "movenet")
data(fake_Scottish_holding_data, package = "movenet")
```

## Generating a temporal network representation

Currently it is possible to generate a temporal network (networkDynamic) representation
of movement data and optional holding data, as follows:

```{R warning = FALSE}
# Create a networkDynamic from our data
network <- movedata2networkDynamic(fake_Scottish_movement_data,
                                   holding_data = fake_Scottish_holding_data,
                                   incl_nonactive_holdings = FALSE)
network
```

## (Basic) social network analysis

```{R}
# Perform some analysis - find the maximum reachability
parallel_max_reachabilities(list(network), n_threads = 8)
```
